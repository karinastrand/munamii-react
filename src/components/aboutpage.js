                At Munamii Cakery, each cake,<br/> each box of cupcakes that we make <br/>
                has a very special value for us.<br/> We not only want to bring a dessert 
                to your table<br/> but rather a unique experience for you,<br/> 
                which will become an unforgettable memory.<br/> 
                We have been in the pastry market for more<br/> than 8 years and now 
                we offer<br/> you a new way to shop through our website.
